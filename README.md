# Youtube Clone <br/>

Ths is a quick youtube clone that I created to test my web crawler. It has all the youtube features like trending, home, and search. There is also a playlist feature that lets you save videos to watch later. Built using expo and reanimated and react native.

I am using youtube video downloader so it is against youtube terms and services

I only did this to test my web crawler and there are some bugs that I didnt care to fix.
